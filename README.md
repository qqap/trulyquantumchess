# TrulyQuantumChess
A game of truly quantum chess, with interference, entanglement, etc.

You can play online in your browser on https://truly-quantum-chess.sloppy.zone.

There is also a mirror of the game on https://quantum-chess.mateowang.dev if the above link is down.

Alternatively, download, build & run your local mongodb and webapp server. To do so simply run:
```
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

For those people who have reached me asking if they can implement their own features: the source code is licensed under WTFPL,
which pretty much means that you can do what the f*ck you want with it :)

However, if you decide to add a feature or two, please consider sending me a pull request so that I can push your changes to prod.
